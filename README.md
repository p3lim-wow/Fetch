## Description

In patch 11.2 Blizzard added a new [Fetch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1232995/fetch) spell specifically for Marksmanship hunters, allowing them to cast an equivalent to the old pet-based [Fetch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=125050/fetch) spell, but without a pet.

The problem with this new spell is that it needs a target to work, and you can't macro it because the player has two spells with the same name in their spell book, and it'll try to use the pet-based version in macros.

This addon fixes that! If this addon finds the new fetch spell on your action bar it'll override the binding (not permanently, don't worry) with a hidden button that will attempt to cast the new Fetch spell on either the last target or on the target under your mouse cursor. There's no configuration needed, it should just work as long as you have the Fetch ability on your action bars somewhere and a key bound to that button.

It's not perfect, there might be bugs, but this works most of the time.
